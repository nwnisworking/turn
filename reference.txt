Client: 63778, Relay: 64247, User: Alice
Client: 63780, Relay: 60920, User: Bob

At this point, a binding and allocate request have been sent.

Bob create permission to join with Alice Relay(64247) (called peer address)
Bob sends an indication to the server to send to Alice relay??
Server sends success create permission response to Bob
Bob's Relay(60920) sends a binding request to Alice's Relay(64247)
Alice's Relay(64247) response with XOR Mapped Address of Bob's Relay(60920)
Server will send data indication to Bob and XOR Peer Address of Alice's relay
